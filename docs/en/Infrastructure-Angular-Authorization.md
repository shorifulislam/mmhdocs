# Authorization

You can inject and use `PermissionCheckerService` to check user permissions. It's pre injected for `AppComponentBase` (permission field) and also you can use shortcut `isGranted` function. Permissions are defined on the backend. See [Role Management](Features-Mvc-Core-Role-Management), [User Management](Features-Mvc-Core-User-Management) or [ASP.NET Boilerplate authorization](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Authorization) document.
