# NSwag

Since all communication to server made via AJAX requests, we are using a
client side javascript layer to call server API. It's automatically
generated by [nswag](https://github.com/NSwag/NSwag) tool using
[swagger](http://swagger.io/). ASP.NET Zero solution is properly
configured for nswag. When you change your server side services, all you
need to do is to run **nswag/refresh.bat** file (or run the command
inside it for a non-Windows OS) while server side (.Host project) is
running.

Generated code is located in
shared/service-proxies/**service-proxies**.ts file. You should not make
manual change in this file since it will be overwritten on the next code
generation.

**Refreshing Service Proxies**

While Nswag automatically generate proxy files, it does not refresh
**service-proxies.module**.ts. If you add a new service, you should
**manually** add it to this file as like others.
