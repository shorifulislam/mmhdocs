## Introduction

In this document, we will create a sample **phonebook application** based on ASP.NET Zero (ASP.NET Core version) step by step. After all steps, we will have a multi-tenant, localized, authorized, configurable,

Find `app-layout-libs.min.js` and remove `node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js` from it.
