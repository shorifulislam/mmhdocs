# Exception Handling

ASP.NET Zero uses ABP's [exception handling](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/AspNet-Core#exception-filter) system. Thus, you don't need to handle & care about exceptions in most time. All server side exceptions are gracefully handled and an appropriate message is shown to the user.
