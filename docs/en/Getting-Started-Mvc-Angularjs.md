# Getting Started

This document is aimed to create and run an ASP.NET Zero based project in just 5 minutes. It's assumed that you already purchased and created your ASP.NET Zero account.

## Login

[Login](https://aspnetzero.com/Account/Login) to this web site with your user name and password. Then you will see [Download](https://aspnetzero.com/Download) link on the main  menu.

## Create a Project

Go to the [download](https://aspnetzero.com/Download) page. You will see a form as shown below:

<img src="images/download-mvc5-jquery.png" alt="Create project" class="img-thumbnail" width="572" height="534" />

Select "**ASP.NET MVC 5.x & jQuery**" or "**ASP.NET MVC 5.x & AngularJS 1.x**" based on your preference. Your project will be ready in one minute. After extracting the downloaded zip file and opening solution in
**Visual Studio**, you will see solution structure as shown below:

<img src="images/solution-overall-2.png" alt="ASP.NET Zero solution structure" class="img-thumbnail" width="242" height="219" />

## Configure The Project

Right click the **.Web** project and select "**Set as StartUp project**": Then **build** the solution. It make take longer time in first build since all **nuget** packages will be restored.

### Database Connection

Open web.config file in the .Web project and change the **Default** connection string if you want:

```xml
<add name="Default" connectionString="Server=localhost; Database=PhoneBook; Trusted_Connection=True;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
```

### Database Migrations

You have two options to create and migrate database to the latest version.

#### ASP.NET Zero Migrator Application

ASP.NET Zero solution includes a **.Migrator** (like Acme.PhoneBook.Migrator) project in the solution. You can run this tool for database migrations on development and production (see [development guide](Development-Guide-Mvc-Angularjs) for more information).

#### Entity Framework Migration Command

You can also use Entity Framework's built-in command line tools for migrations.

Open **Package Manager Console** (Under Tools\\Nuget Package Manager in the main menu), select **.EntityFramework** project as **Default project** and run **Update-Database** command.

This command will create your database and fill initial data. You can open SQL Server Management Studio to check if database is created:

<img src="images/created-database-tables-3.png" alt="ASP.NET Zero Database Tables" class="img-thumbnail" width="243" height="507" />

You can use EF console commands for development and Migrator.exe for production. But notice that; Migrator.exe supports running migrations in multiple databases at once, which can be useful in development/production for multi tenant applications.

### Multi-Tenancy

ASP.NET Zero supports multi-tenant and single-tenant applications. Multi-tenancy is **enabled by default**. If you don't have idea about multi-tenancy or don't want to create a multi-tenant application, you can **disable** it by setting **AbpZeroTemplateConsts.MultiTenancyEnabled** to false in the .Core project.

## Run The Project

All ready.. just run your solution. It will open home page of your web site. You can click login link at top right corner to **login** to the application:

<img src="images/login-screen.png" alt="ASP.NET Zero Login page" class="img-thumbnail" width="431" height="414" />

Enter **default** as tenancy name (this field is shown if multi-tenancy is enabled), **admin** as user name and **123qwe** as password. You should change password at first login. After login to the application, you will see sample dashboard screen:

<img src="images/default-dashboard2.png" alt="Dashboard" class="img-thumbnail" width="800" height="594" />

If your application is multi-tenant, then you can leave tenancy name as **empty** in login screen and use **admin** as user name and **123qwe** as password to login as **host admin**.
