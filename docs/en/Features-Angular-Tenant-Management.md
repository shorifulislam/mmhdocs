# Tenant Management

*If you're not developing a multi-tenant application, you can skip this section.*

If this is a multi-tenant application and you logged in as a host user, then tenants page is shown:

A tenant is represented by **Tenant** class. Tenant class [can be extended](Extending-Existing-Entities.md) by adding new properties. There is an only one tenant, named **Default** as initial. **Tenancy Name** (code name, which can be used as subdomain) is the **unique** name of a tenant. AÂ tenant can be **active** or **passive**. If it's passive, no user of this tenant can login to the application.

When we click the "**Create New Tenant**" button, a dialog is shown:

**Tenancy name** should be unique and can not contain spaces or other special chars since it may be used as subdomain name (like tenancyname.mydomain.com). **Name** can be anything. **Admin email** is used as email address of the admin user of new tenant. Admin user is automatically created with the tenant. We can set a random password for admin and send activation email. When user first logins, they should change the password. We can uncheck this to enter a known password.

When we create a new tenant, we should select/create a database to store new tenant's data. We can select '**Use host database**' to store tenant data in host database (can be used for single database approach) or we can specify a connection string to create/use a **dedicated database** for new tenant. ASP.NET Zero supports **hybrid** approach. That means you can use host database for some tenants and create dedicated databases for some other tenants. Even you can **group** some tenants in a separated database.

Once you assign an edition to the tenant, you can select an expiration date (see [edition management](Features-Angular-Edition-Management) section to know what happens after subscription expiration).

#### Tenant Edition and Features

An **edition** can be **assigned** to a tenant (while creating or editing). Tenant will inherit all features of the assigned edition, but we can also override features and values for a tenant. Click **actions/change features** for a tenant to **customize** it's features:

#### Tenant User Impersonation

As a host user, we may want to perform operations on behalf of a tenant. In this case, we can click the "**Login as this tenant**" button in the actions. When we click it, we see **a modal to select a user** of the
tenant. We can select any user and perform operations allowed that user. See [User Impersonation](Features-Angular-User-Management#user-impersonation) section of user management document for more information.

#### Using Tenancy Name As Subdomain

A multi-tenant application generally uses subdomain to identify current tenant. **tenant1**.mydomain.com, **tenant2**.mydomain.com and so on. ASP.NET Zero automatically identify and get tenant name from subdomain. See [Multi Tenancy](Overview-Angular#multi-tenancy) and [Configuration](Overview-Angular#configuration) sections of overview document.
